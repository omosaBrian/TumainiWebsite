Expanding the Bounds of Learning with Virtual Reality

* * *

Our classrooms are no longer static entities confined by four walls. At our international school in Nairobi, through the amalgamation of VR and the Metaverse, we're creating dynamic, interactive ecosystems where subjects come alive, inviting students to explore, question, and understand in ways previously unimaginable. VR-based sessions redefine the boundaries of learning, making it an experiential journey rather than a passive acquisition of information.
